## !This is work in progress!

I am going through Railscasts in 2019 and this is my list of episodes I think that you could benefit from even if they are ancient in internet years.

TL;DR:
  - list of episodes with comments with my thoughts why they are still relevant is on the bootom of this page

  <br>

When I started my career in software development as a hobby railscassts was on the peek. But soon right after Ryan Bates took a long vacation from making screencasts and I never got back. Sure we got great screencasts like GoRails, Ruby Tapas and Drifting Ruby but I want to see if there are still relevant tutorials exercises for Rails 6.0 and above.

Over the last few years I heard a lot of people still talking about Railscasts as a resource that helped them tremendously with their leveling up.

By going through the first 50 episodes I found out that even if the episodes are from 2007 there are quite few ones that are still applicable today.

When you go through suggested episodes I suggest you install the latest Ruby and Rails version and code along or if you are like me I first watch the episode and try to implement the exercise myself. Use api.rubyonrails.org and guides.rubyonrails.org as reference.

If you are complete beginner I suggest you first go through [rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) before watching and coding along with Railscasts.

Of course not every episode has not aged well so that is why I decidet that I will create this blog post that will have TLDR with relevant episodes on top and episodes with comment on why I think this episode could be of use to you.
