Whenever I learn something new and this could be either new technology or programming language I create a list of three resources. Normally my list consists of a book, a course and a project. When creating a list to learn Elixir I found a cool new way to learn.

Elixir's programming language main website has link to [the learning resources](https://elixir-lang.org/learning.html) which contains almost too much material to digest in reasonable amount of time. When learning new technology I always try to find the best resources and not spend too much time on the average book or course. To find out a great book I use [goodreads.com](http://goodreads.com/).

For learning Elixir my short list was:
- [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io/) this is my #1 resource for learning new programming language
- Book by Dave Thomas: [Programming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6)

And then I found a link to [the ElixirCards](https://elixircards.co.uk/). The cards are not the cheapest so I waited few days to think if this is worth the price. After receiving them I can definitely say this is a great product. First lets talk about the build quality. The quality of the cards is level above the cards of [the famous programmers](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/programmer-playing-cards/) I got a while back. There are no scratches after few month of use of ElixirCards while the other cards had scratches after just few weeks of usage.

I have been using flashcards for few months now. What I can say is that I knew that this cards would be probably something that I would enjoy but I was pleasantly surprised how enjoyable learning new programming language could be. This is amazing new way to learn.

I got all 12 packs of ElixirCards + 2 packs of GitCards which is 700+ flash cards and it will take me a while to master the content. But I know I will have blast doing so. If you are kinesthetic or visual learner like I am this flashcards could be of help you.
