I just got my set of flashcards from [the ElixirCards](https://elixircards.co.uk/). The quality of the cards is level above the cards of [the famous programmers](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/programmer-playing-cards/) I got a while back.

I knew that this cards would be probably something that I would enjoy but I was pleasantly surprised how enjoyable learning new programming language could be.

I bought all 12 packs which is 600+ flash cards and it will take me a while to master the Elixir programming language. But I know I will have blast while doing so. I know that flashcards are not enough to be proficient in any programming language so I will complement this resource to other resources:
- [Exercism.io](this is my #1 resource for learning new programming language)
- [Book by Dave Thomas: Programming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6)

If you are kinesthetic or visual learner like I am this it the kind thing you will like.
