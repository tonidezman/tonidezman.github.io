My primary tool for taking notes is Evernote. It has been one of my main tools for capturing the knowledge I want to retain.
I tried OneNote and I think this tool is great on Windows but on Mac it is missing the screen capture functionality.

Anki is great because when you are repeating certain subject you give the feedback on how hard was the question. Under the hood Anki is able to give you questions that you need to repeat in order to retain this knowledge.

I used Anki in the past but didn't stick with it. I just found out that Anki has a lot of plugins which make the app more appealing. [Tutorial on Anki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urUZUWoTLo)
