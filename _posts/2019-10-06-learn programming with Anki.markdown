My primary tool for taking notes is Evernote. It has been one of my main tools for capturing the knowledge I want to retain.
I tried OneNote and I think this tool is great on Windows but on Mac it is missing the screen capture functionality.

Anki is great because when you are learning/repeating certain subject it optimizes the space repetition to gain the best results possible and not forgetting about things you want to remember.

I used Anki in the past but didn't stick with it. I just found out that Anki has a lot of plugins which make the app more appealing. [Tutorial on Anki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urUZUWoTLo).
