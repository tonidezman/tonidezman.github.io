tldr;
- You need to practice coding every day.
- This practice sessions need to be intense.
- You can have this practice sessions twice a day. 2h in the morning and 90 min in the afternoon.
- sleep at least 8 hours every day.

If you look at timelines you will found out that there are several books that use Anders Ericsson's research. The 10.000 hours rule to became good at any skill was popularized by Malcom Gladwell in the book Outliers.

I see the reasons why Anders wanted to write his own book on the subject of deliberate practice. Because other book writers didn't completely understand his research on the subject he was kind enough to enlighten us on the subject.

Main differences comparing Peak and other books:
- practice doesn't make perfect. Practice makes permanent.
- 10.000 hour rule is not rule at all. In some cases it is 200 hour and in other cases it is more like 25.000 hour rule.
- most skills can be obtained in your 20s, 30s, 40s and beyond.

The one thing that stood the most out for me in the book "The Talent Code" is that most genioues lost one or both parents when they were quite young. The author suggests that this brought great pressior and sense of hostile environment. All this pressiored young geniouses to practice evan harder.

That said I want to talk about my own experience and what I noticed when following other great programmers. What I found out is that most good programmers that I know were tramatized by some difficult experience either losing their job or being threten too loose their job. This forced them to become good.

You could ask me: "What about Peak? What was the most notable thing about that book?". For me it was the authors suggestion that knowledge while being important to accuire skills are evan more important. This changed how I learn things about programming in my spare time. I first do deliberate practice for about 3.5 hours and than I do "easy" stuff like reading books.

But what kind of deliberate practice should I do?

Remember that deliberate practice should not be enjoyable thing you do. At best it should be neutral. If you are doing deliberate practice and enjoying yourself stop and think if what you are doing is the most efficient thing you are doing in building up your skills.

For programmers there are a lot of categories to get better at:
- coding challenges (the best current resources is leetcode.com and EPI book)
- system design (search for Grokking the System Design by Educative)
- TDD (search for TDD katas)
- Refactoring (search for refactoring katas, pick up Refactoring book by Marting Fowler)
- SQL (executeprogram.com, academy.vertabelo.com)
- creating clone/toy app
- ...

I think programming is one of the best fields to be in because there is allways something to learn but remember that fundamentals are the most important. The shiny new things like learning the latest new framework is necessary but will be obsolete in few years. Fundamentals like learning networking, operating system, SQL etc. will probably stay the same for decades to come.

> And remember practice every day. It is much better to practice every day for 90 minutes than doing the same amount of cumulative hours on the weekend.
