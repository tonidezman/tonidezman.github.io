When I was first learning to code I remember that I had a lot of fun learning
new things and being proud of the things I have built. For the last few years I
have been learning a lot and improving my skills. But there was a price to pay
and programming stopped being fun anymore.

To combat this I decided I will be doing side projects. The first one is
building a simple 2d game. This is my implementation of`The pong game`. If you
want to practice with me you can go to

<strong>
[this github repository](https://github.com/tonidezman/pong/tree/master)
</strong>

and play around with the game. You can look at my architecture beforehand or
just implement this game from scratch.

After finishing this project I found my self being happier. This was a fun
little weekend project :)
